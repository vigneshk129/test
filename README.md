Flower Prediction using Flask and Machine Learning
This project is a web-based application built with Flask that predicts the type of flower based on input features, using a machine learning model. The model has been trained on a dataset of various flowers, leveraging machine learning algorithms to classify them. The Flask application serves as the interface for users to interact with the model by inputting flower characteristics like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Key Features:
Flask Web App: Simple and interactive user interface to input flower data.
Machine Learning Model: Trained on a dataset (e.g., Iris dataset) to predict flower species.
Real-time Prediction: Instant classification results based on user input.
Technologies Used:
Flask: For building the web application.
Machine Learning (scikit-learn): For training the predictive model.
HTML/CSS: For designing the user interface.
Python: For backend development and model implementation.
Setup & Installation:
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-prediction.git
Install the necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:
bash
Copy
python app.py
Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the web application.
How to Use:
Enter the values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width in the provided input fields.
Click "Predict" to get the predicted flower species.
The model will display the predicted flower species based on the input values.
